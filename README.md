# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this challnage is to: 
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![](images\filename%20segment_1_summary_of_linear_regression.png)

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    * 
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    * 
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
